# CrystLamp
CrystLamp is a lamp designed for makers. Using laser-cutter, acrylic sheets, and a simple assembly, makers can easily build a lamp that lets them beautifully decorate their space. By open-sourcing and using open-sourced components, the lamp can be easily distributed over the internet and made by anyone. CrystLamp crystalizes my belief in an open future, where open-source distribution democratizes design for the community.
